## Why isn't there a hosted version of this project?

Rate Limits. The API used is an unofficial one. As such, Threads can enforce rate limits that are IP based and can restrict access. If we hosted this project, chances are that it could get immediately rate limited, or worse, blocked permanently by Threads. Hence, the best way to use the application would be for individual users to deploy and use v/s working with a hosted solution.
